# Personal-Web-CV
My personal web CV and blog

#Simple website, using HTML/CSS and JS

#My personal web cv besides being a promotional tool for me to find jobs and clients it is also where I like to practice my web development skills.

#I might work on a new version and fork it here

#Feel free to suggest changes, or even new segments that use Javascript for interactiveness.

#I'd like to find some time and experiment to create a chat tool and chatbot with machine learning and AI capabilities (just for fun)

#This project is taking a step-back since I am focusing on ML and my skills as a data scientist.
