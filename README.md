# Personal-Web-CV
My personal web CV and blog

#My personal web cv besides being a promotional tool for me to find jobs and clients it is also where I like to practice my web development skills.

#The languages I like to use are HTML, CSS, and Javascript (mainly)

#Feel free to suggest changes, or even new segments that use Javascript for interactiveness.

#I'd like to find some time and experiment to create a chat tool and chatbot with machine learning and AI capabilities (just for fun)

#Right now I'm going to create a Javascript element to showcase the projects I currently experiment with, it should be fun.
